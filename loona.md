# Loona Theories

## Vivid

In Vivid, Heejin changes outfit repeatedly throughout the music video, resulting in a grand total of 11 outfits, to the best of my knowledge. With a number that close to 12, it is hard not to get a bit suspicious, and the fact that many of the shots in Vivid resemble shots of other characters in other MVs certainly doesn't detract from the mystery. Below I have them listed in order of appearance in the MV.

![Outfit #1](/images/vivid_screenshot_00.png)
Top: Lacy navy blue blouse with (épaulettes?)
Earrings: Large black disks surrounded by 12 gold studs
Accessories: White flower on left collar, chain around collar

These shots are among the most interesting, not least because they include the first time in the LOONA filmography that the recurring mouth-down perspective is used. As we shall see, such a perspective is not only quite common, but is predominantly associated with certain characters.

## Who is the girl circling around OEC in Loonatic and Girl Front?

From the Mix&Match album description:

그리고 아직 공개되지 않은 새로운 소녀가 오드아이써클을 중심으로 공전한다.
And a yet-to-be-released new girl circles around Odd Eye Circle.

This implies that the girl is a member of yyxy, since at the time Mix&Match was published, all other girls had been revealed. Of the theories about the identity of the girl, those supporting a member of yyxy generally consider it to be Yves or Olivia, both due to parallels with scenes in later MVs. Note that we already have an example of the identity of an unknown girl being revealed in this manner; the person pulling Jinsoul's left earphone out in Sweet Crazy Love is revealed to be Olivia through a scene of Jinsoul pulling Olivia's right earphone out in Egoist. An important fact to note about this is that the juxtaposed scene is mirrored in some ways; it is Jinsoul pulling Olivia's earphone out and not vice versa, it is the right ear that is pulled out and not the left. Many in the Yves camp point to the scene in Heart Attack with Chuu circling around Yves as evidence that it is Yves, but it is not Chuu that is in the center in Girl Front/Loonatic, but OEC. A much closer parallel is the scene in Hi High that shows the OEC members approaching Olivia, while the camera pans in a circular motion. However, there is another scene that is in fact a perfect mirror of the scene in question; in Love&Live near the end of the choreography, Hyunjin, Haseul, and Vivi are shown circling around Heejin in a clockwise direction.



This is practically a perfect mirror, in all respects, of Olivia circling around Choerry, Kim Lip, and Jinsoul in a counterclockwise direction. The only mismatch is that Jinsoul's mirror is not Vivi, but Yeojin; but recall that, in all probability, Yeojin was supposed to be the fourth member of 1/3, and Vivi seems to be hastily associated with Jinsoul in Yeojin's stead. In a hypothetical version of 1/3 where Yeojin is not replaced by Vivi, the mirror is perfect.

On a more subjective note, it just looks like Olivia.

## Lyrics

### Vivid

아침부터 이미 Dejavu
낯설어도 또 같은 하루
숨어볼까? 달아나 볼까?
고민고민 해

까만 모자 속 뒤적여도
잡히는 건 또 늘 같은걸
하얀 토끼나 비둘기
That’s all same

매일 내 맘속 Flash
빛나던 Rainbow
아무 색 없는 세계 지루해
니 손끝으로 바꿔줄래
빨주노초 더 진하게 Be okay?

Oh my god yes
Say, Oh my god yes
칠해줘 가득 날 많은 색깔로
Oh my god yes
Say, Oh my goodness
하루 종일 나 웃음이 나
가슴이 두근대도록

많은 색깔로 채워줘 빨주노초
Something highlight
Surprising changes
하루 종일 나 웃음이나
가슴이 두근대도록

Happy ending 또 같은 결말
너 없는 나 So what I can do?
별거 없는 레파토린
그만그만해

난 걷고 싶어Like runway
도도해도 좀 달라 보이게
너에게 날 보여줄게
That’s my heart

매일 내 맘속 Flash
빛나던 Rainbow
늘 같은 흑백영화 지루해
니 손끝으로 바꿔줄래
빨주노초 더 진하게 Be okay?

Oh my god yes
Say, Oh my god yes
칠해줘 가득 날 많은 색깔로
Oh my god yes
Say, Oh my goodness
하루 종일 나 웃음이 나
널 만난 그 순간부터

Good morning
눈뜨는 아침마다
새로운 날이길
그대로 무뎌지긴
싫어 빛을 잃은 내게

Oh my god yes
Say 오늘 같은
이대로 가득
더 많은 색깔로

똑 같은 색 Say
남 다른 색
모두 모두가 안달이
나 미치게 두근대도록

많은 색깔로 채워줘 빨주노초
Something highlight
Surprising changes
하루 종일 나 웃음이나
니가 날 바라보잖아
